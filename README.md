# Macro Keyboard Hub (WIP)

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is supposed to be version 2.0 of my Macro Keyboard Hub. As I was no longer happy with the GUI I made with 
PySimpleGui, I will try to make it look better with Flutter. As of right now, this is a Work in Progress, it does 
not have the required functionalities right now.
